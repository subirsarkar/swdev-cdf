<H2>
A Graphical User Interface to the <FONT color=blue>svtvme</FONT> Library
</H2>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
User interaction with the SVT system is accomplished with the help of a library 
of functions, written in C and built on top of the FISION library of functions for 
access to VME. The library, aptly called, <FONT color=blue>svtvme</FONT> has matured 
a lot over time and it is now appropriate to have a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
to the underlying library that would allow 
<UL>
  <LI>Easy access to all the SVT boards in some uniform fashion</LI>
  <LI>Diagnostics of individual boards in situ (testing rams/FIFOs/registers etc.) </LI>
  <LI>Diagnostics of single boards using standard cabling for I/O of test data</LI>
</UL>

Different single board diagnostic tools, both simple and expert level, which have been 
in use are described in brief below,
<UL>
  <LI> A number of <I>text based</I> and <I>menu driven</I> programs for individual 
       boards written in C.
       These programs are simple to use but do not have a  consistent layout for
       all the SVT boards. This has caused them to remain mostly in the expert
       domain.</LI>
  <LI> Random test style extensive multi-board test suite written with a specific
       goal in mind. </LI>
  <LI> <FONT COLOR=#104e8b>CORBA/Robin</FONT> remote object protocol based 
       <FONT COLOR=#2e8b57>cdfvme/svtDaq</FONT> that can accomplish 
       multi-board tests. This tool is written in Java and although it is quite 
       complete and configurable it is at the same time rather heavy with 
       graphics, slow in execution due to overhead of <FONT COLOR=#104e8b>CORBA</FONT> and less 
       intuitive. The question of maintainability also goes against this application
       framework.</LI>
  <LI> Java Native Interface (JNI) over the <FONT COLOR=blue>svtvme</FONT> 
       C library which allows Java based user interface (reused and simplified from 
       <FONT COLOR=#2e8b57>svtDaq</FONT>) to access the SVT boards 
       directly. This option has been considered to be a promising one as all the 
       power of Java as a GUI toolkit could be used to access the VME directly 
       without the overhead of <FONT COLOR=#104e8b>CORBA</FONT> which would make the 
       application lighter and a lot more efficient for simple tasks.</LI>
  <LI> <FONT COLOR=#ff4500>Interactive Python/JPython</FONT> scripting, 
       a very simple and powerful way of interacting with the boards. This option has 
       all the power of menu driven text based tools in addition to being infinitely 
       configurable. Unfortunately, <FONT COLOR=#ff4500>Python</FONT>, although very 
       simple and compact, is not the programming language which is as common as C.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
From the above description, it is clear that tools are scattered and require a 
healthy amount of maintenance work. So we proposed to build a light and configurable GUI 
application, which will incorporate all the advantages of the existing applications,
in order to be able to use a single user interface to all the SVT boards. For graphics 
based interface JNI seemed to be the natural choice in the beginning. But, as an all C 
solution to the problem is preferred to reduce maintenance overhead we looked for and 
finally found an alternative to using Java/JNI in Gtk+/GNOME. Gtk+/GNOME is the basis 
of the GNOME desktop on Linux and is likely to be supported at least in the mid-term 
future although we might be on our own as Gtk+/GNOME is not supported fully yet in CDF 
online. </P>

<P>Gtk+/GNOME has a very rich set of graphics widgets. The API 
is simple to use. The GUI builder <FONT color=red>glade</FONT> can help in producing 
very high quality graphics with very little effort. Unfortunately, 
<FONT color=red>glade</FONT> produces a monolithic  body of code which defeats 
the very idea of code reuse. One has to rearrange <FONT color=red>glade</FONT> 
generated code manually. </P>

<P>
We quickly built a very preliminary prototype of the application and requested for suggestions
from the community. After receiving valuable suggestions we went on implementing the
first version of the application, called <FONT color=green>svtgui</FONT>. We describe
below the interface in detail.</P>

<H3>Description</H3>
<P>The application consists of a single window along-with a file browser which makes it
lightweight and dynamic in nature. As soon as a board is selected/connected the interface 
changes itself to show Register/Memory/FIFO/Spy list only relevant to that board.
The main window is divided into five distinct parts as shown in Figure 1, namely
<UL>
  <LI>A Menubar and a Toolbar</LI>
  <LI>A panel containing the Crate/Board/Slot selection pull-down lists</LI>
  <LI>A notebook containing the following pages</LI>
    <UL>
      <LI>Global board status</LI>
      <LI>Memory operation </LI>
      <LI>Spy buffer related operation</LI>
      <LI>Board register read/write/test</LI>
      <LI>Board FIFO related operation</LI>
      <LI>Sending data to the board</LI>
    </UL>
  <LI>Another notebook widget which contains the input/output text areas in addition
      to a scripting window.</LI>
  <LI>A Statusbar at the bottom</LI>
</UL>

<P>
One can connect to any arbitrary but valid crate/board/slot combination from the application.
In the present context, we refer to the final SVT configuration to be used in CDF as 
the 'Standard Configuration', i.e crates b0svt00 ... b0svt07 and the boards therein. 
The configuration where any arbitrarily valid board can be opened is referred to as 
'Custom Configuration'. The application starts by default as a non-standard one. However, The 
'Standard Configuration', can be selected at run time from the <FONT COLOR=red>Setting</FONT> 
menu. With non-standard 
configuration one must click on an <FONT COLOR=blue>svtvme</FONT> operation related button to 
open the board as well as to update the Register/Memory/FIFO/spy lists in the appropriate 
pull-down lists. We have singled out the <B>Refresh</B> button which checks,
<UL>
  <LI>the internal consistency of the board just opened</LI>
  <LI>if the board is in Run/Test mode</LI>
  <LI>the output hold</LI>
  <LI>all the FIFOs to see if empty</LI>
  <LI>if the spy buffers are frozen. In addition to that it displays the spy pointer and the 
      pointer overflow bit for the selected board spy buffer. </LI>
</UL> 

If the custom option is chosen it is upto the user to choose a valid board whereas for
the standard option, one cannot edit but can only select valid Crate/Board/Slot combination
from the pull-down lists which are updated automatically once a valid entry is selected for
the Crate/Board. For custom option, any SVT related button first connects to the board and 
updates the Register/Memory/FIFO/spy lists, so only after the lists are updated should one 
try to look at a different quantity. In order to take advantage of the new functions available
in the <FONT color=blue>svtvme</FONT> library we are planning to make modification so that 
both the options describe above appear the same.

<H3>Global Board Status</H3>
<P>
The global status window consists of the following as can be seen from Figure 1,
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Board Initialisation button</LI>
  <LI>Test/Run mode status display along-with Test Mode <B>Enable/Disable</B> button</LI>
  <LI>FIFO status display as a single quantity which is green only when all the FIFOs 
      corresponding to that board are empty</LI>
  <LI>Output HOLD status</LI>
  <LI>Reading/Writing of a word at an address a certain number of times</LI>
  <LI>Board Identifier, namely board type and serial number.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Board Memory Read/Write/Test/Check Operations</H3>
<P>
This panel, shown in figure 2, allows us to test a single memory a number of times.
One can read a number of words starting at an offset and either display the data in the 
output text area or dump to a file. In a similar manner one can write a number of words 
starting at an offset, where the data could be typed in the input text area or taken 
from a file. This page is not complete and we have to implement operations like 
<FONT COLOR=red>Check</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=red>Verify</FONT>  etc.
</P>

<H3>Spy Buffer Reading </H3>
<P>In this panel one can select a Spy Buffer of a board from the pull down list. 
Options are provided which allow data to be displayed in the output text
area or dumped to a file. One can also input the number of words to be read
or alternatively choose to read the whole buffer. At the bottom row, we provide facilities
to locally freeze/unfreeze the board spy buffers using the Spy Control board
which sits in the same crate as that of the board under investigation.</P>

<H3>Board Register Read/Write/Test Operations</H3>
<P>
The board register panel is shown in Figure 4. This is the simplest page of all.
At a time one can test/read/write five different registers selecting the from the 
pull down menu. As a default the first five registers of the selected board are
displayed. The same text fields are used for both read and write operations. The
'ClearAll' button clears all the input/output text fields. Selecting a new board 
automatically clears all the input/output text fields.</P>

<H3>Board FIFO Related Operation</H3>
<P>
In this panel, shown in Figure 5, the board FIFO status are shown for individual FIFO.
Data from FIFO can be read and displayed or dumped to a file. The board FIFO can be 
selected from a pull-down list.

<H3>Sending Data to SVT Boards</H3>
<P>
<FONT color=blue>svtvme</FONT> library provides a number of functions in order 
to send data to a board,
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>A number of words sent only once at a specified speed</LI>
  <LI>A number of words sent in a loop</LI>
  <LI>The same data is sent once again</LI>
  <LI>The same data is sent again in a loop</LI>
  <LI>The same data is sent again</LI>
</UL>
As shown in Figure 6, one can also choose the data source to be a file or 
the input area (where each line in the file or the input text area should contain
one data word in a hex format). One should also specify the number of words 
to be sent as well.

<H3>Usage</H3>
<P>The application is standalone and can be started simply performing the following,
<PRE>
setup svtvme -d
svtgui  (an alias to $SVTVME_DIR/svtgui/bin/svtgui_Linux)
</PRE>

<H3>Future</H3>
In the next version we would like to add the following capabilities to the existing
application,
<UL>
  <LI>Command line arguments</LI>
  <LI><I>New</I> and <I>Close</I> items in the <B>File</B> menu which will allow us to open 
      extra windows and to work independently to connect to different boards from the 
      same application.</LI>
  <LI>New window with editing capabilities for a large amount of data</LI>
  <LI>Compare data read with old ones.</LI>
  <LI>A Python interpreter embedded within the application which makes the tool much more
      flexible and powerful</LI>
  <LI>Displaying data in various formats</LI>
  <LI>Implementing new functionalities available in the <FONT color=blue>svtvme</FONT>
      library in place of custom code.</LI>
  <LI>Better look and feel of the UI</LI>
</UL>

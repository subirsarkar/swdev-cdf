How to run
----------

I do this:
1) log on to b0dap08.fnal.gov
2) type
   cd ~cozzi/vme
3) type
   ./svtLurk
It works. Most of the time.
If something is not working:
1) check DISPLAY environment variable and xhost configuration
   ("xhost +b0dap08" helps!)
2) change computer. It works on b0dap08, but not on some other computers.

Requirements
------------

svtvme library
jsvtvme (java version of svtvme library)
java
jpython

Have a look at ~cozzi/vme/svtLurk (it's a shell script) to see the exact
setup needed to run the program.

Explanation
-----------

svtLurk is a shell script which setups the environment and invokes the jpython
interpreter.

svtClasses.py is a jpython file which contains some class definitions, useful
to use jsvtvme library in an object-oriented way. This file could be useful
for other people too. It should also run on CPython (but I'm not sure: there
are some circular reference; Java has got a true garbage collector, while
CPython uses reference counting. If you try, let me know.)

svtLurk.py is the graphical interface. It uses Swing to display the data.
There is one svtMonitor (the window with the eight buttons); when you press a
button, a crateMonitor is created. It then reads its configuration file and
creates some boardMonitor according to the configuration file.
Every boardMonitor knows which spy it should monitors, and creates the
spyMonitors.
Every two seconds (the time is configurable), the timer ticks and tells the
svtMonitor to update itself. svtMonitor asks every open crateMonitor to update.
Every crateMonitor asks its boardMonitor to update, and these in turn ask every
spyMonitor to update. Very slow, don't you think? And consider that the program
is written in JPython...

b0svt0[0-7].config are the crate configuration files. If you swap boards in
the crate, you don't even need to change the python file: just update these
files. They are really simple to use!

GIF/[green|yellow|red].gif are the icons used for the LEDs. I found
these pictures on the net (they were bullets for web pages).

Comments
--------

I used RCS (Revision Control System) for svtClasses.py and svtLurk.py.
If you want to go back to an older version, you can.
Just read the RCS man pages!

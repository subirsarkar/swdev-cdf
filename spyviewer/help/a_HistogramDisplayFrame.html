<H2>Histogram Viewer </H2>

<FONT size=-1>
A Java based Histogram viewer built upon <FONT COLOR=green>Java Analysis Studio (JAS)</FONT> 
developed by Tony Johnson et. al. The application is integrated within spyGUI but could be used as a 
standalone SmartSockets client as well. Histograms are created/updated from histogram 
messages published by the SVT Crates. At present only 1- and 2-D histograms are supported.
For two dimesional histograms only binned informations are available.<BR>

<BR>
The application is divided in two parts, 
<UL>
  <LI>a list view which displays the histogram list as a tree structure </LI>
  <LI>a canvas.</LI>
</UL>
One can divide the canvas into a number of 
zones. Individual plotting panels are active and one can click the right button 
on various objects (data, axis, statistics box etc.) to popup self-explained menus which 
can be used to customise almost all the histogram attributes like, line, background and 
fill colors, statistics elements, error bars, axis titles, axis ranges etc. The histograms 
being displayed can also be printed in this way. However, if more than one histograms
are displayed, saving/printing may be cumbersome.

<UL>
  <LI>Save text from the message area in a file</LI>
  <LI>Configure (not yet implemented)</LI>

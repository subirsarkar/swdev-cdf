<H2>Individual Spy Buffer Display Window</H2>

<FONT size=+0>
Displays individual Spy Buffer informations in a number of ways. The window consists of 
<OL>
  <LI>The <FONT COLOR=green>MenuBar</FONT></LI>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT COLOR=blue>File</FONT>; <FONT COLOR=green>Connect</FONT> to, 
        <FONT COLOR=red>Disconnect</FONT> from the SmartSockets server;  
         usual basic services.</LI>
    <LI><FONT COLOR=blue>Options</FONT>; When run online the display automatically 
        gets updated with most recent data. <B>Auto update</B> of display 
        can be switched on/off. Turning <B>Debug</B> option on is expert only.</LI>
    <LI><FONT COLOR=blue>View</FONT>; one can view (1) all the words, (2) EoE words alone. For
        Physics format, the first option does not show the decoded EE but the raw data display
        contains all the words</LI>
    <LI><FONT COLOR=blue>Action</FONT>; (1) Open a tiny tool to decode SVT words into physics
        format interactively, (2) Analyse the Spy buffer dump. This is the most important
        analysis-level feature of the tool.</LI>
  </UL>
  <LI>The <FONT COLOR=green>ToolBar</FONT>; when used in standalone mode, contains 
      <FONT COLOR=green>Connect</FONT> 
      and <FONT COLOR=red>Disconnect</FONT> buttons to establish/stop communication with 
      the SmartSockets Server</LI>
  <LI>A <FONT COLOR=green>Tree</FONT> showing all the Crate->Board->SpyBuffers. The list is 
      dynamically built from crate status messages. This list allows us to browse all the 
      buffers from a single window. As soon as the first set of Svt Status messages is 
      received from all the crates, the application unsubscribes for Crate Status message. 
      The tree shows the list of all the buffers of the SVT system but by default only a 
      few buffers are sent from the crates as messages. We distinguish those buffers which
      contain data from others which do not by changing the icons as soon as data is
      received for that buffer.</LI>
  <LI><FONT COLOR=green>Spy Buffer Dispplay</FONT> panel. The panel consists of,
    <UL>
      <LI>Global Error (EE) status, which consists of
        <UL>
          <LI>Spy Buffer status window, 
            <UL>
              <LI>Spy pointer value</LI>
              <LI>Freeze status bit</LI>
              <LI>Pointer overflow bit</LI>
            </UL>
          </LI>
          <LI>Most recent status of the 8 individual EE Error bits</LI>
          <LI>EE error informations in some more detail in tabular form.
             The table (at the bottom of Global Error window) displays 
             <UL>
               <LI> Number of times EE errors have occurred and 
                    the % fraction of occurrance of EE errors in the latest buffer.</LI>
               <LI> Total cumulative number of times EE errors have occurred and 
                    the % fraction of occurrance of EE errors.</LI>
             </UL>
          </LI>
        </UL>
      </LI>

      <LI>Buffer display, (1) Board format, (2) Raw Hexadecimal format.</LI> 
      <LI>A plotting widget, consists of a canvas and a list. For each type of buffer a few
          basic quatities are histogrammed. There is an experimental interactive histogramming
          panel also (The 'Command' tab next to the 'List' tab which displays histograms
          which are craeted and filled automatically.)</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI>The <FONT COLOR=green>Message Logger</FONT> area, display SmartSockets related messages etc.</LI>
  <LI>The <FONT COLOR=green>StatusBar</FONT>; displays,
    <UL>
      <LI>Status messages like 'Ready', 'Updating', Tooltip on buttons, menu etc.</LI>
      <LI>Fully qualified name of the buffer</LI>
      <LI>Total number of words received for that buffer</LI>
      <LI>'All' or 'EE' words</LI>
      <LI>Available data formats </LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
</OL>

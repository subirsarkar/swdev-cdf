<H2>A Custom Frame</H2>

<FONT size=-1>
A simple data display window, consists of 
<UL>
   <LI>A Menubar with most frequenty used items</LI>
   <LI>A Toolbar with a few essential buttons</LI>
   <LI>A status area</LI>
   <LI>A Message logger and a File open/save dialog</LI>
</UL>

The frame is supposed to act as a base class for more sophisticated custom 
frames. This window provides a consistent look and feel for all the windows
across the application. It also provides a uniform strtegy for closing a 
window. It however does not dictate placement of the components beyond a 
minimum.<BR><BR>

In order to implement a help window for the derived application window, 
all one has to do is invoke <CODE>setHelpFile()</CODE> method and pass 
the appropriate filename and the help window size. <BR><BR>

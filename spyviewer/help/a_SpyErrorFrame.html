<H2>Spy Buffer Error Window</H2>

<FONT size=-1>
Displays global errors for all the spy buffers of all the boards present in a 
crate. If more than one crates send error messages all the crate panels are 
added as separate pages in a tabbed pane. Clicking on individual buttons 
provides informations on the errors in a separate window.<BR>

<BR>
Tooltips are provided extensively as the buttons are small and the names are cryptic.
When the mouse enters/rests on a button a brief description is displayed on the 
status area as well.

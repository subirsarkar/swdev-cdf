<H2>Spy Buffer Analysis Configuration</H2>

<FONT size=-1>
Configures the spymon analysis options in the SVT crates. A single message is created, 
either for one crate at a time or a common one valid for all the crates and published 
via SmartSockets. The configuration options are described in detail below.

<UL>
  <LI>Mode of monitoring,
    <UL> 
       <LI>wait for Run_Control partition to become available </LI>
       <LI>do routine tasks even when the partition does not come into being.</LI>
     </UL></LI>
  <LI>Run Mode, 
    <UL> 
       <LI>Routine pole and reading of spy buffers even if there is
           no freeze from outside. This option has to be elaborated in future
           to make it more flexible.</LI>
    </UL></LI>
  <LI> Spy buffer Analysis options
     <UL>
        <LI>Analyse/Skip the buffer under consideration</LI>
        <LI>Read Spy buffers</LI>
        <LI>Dump to disk</LI>
        <LI>Fill and publish histograms</LI>
        <LI>Perform board/crate based simulation</LI>
     </UL></LI>
  <LI>For a selected buffer,
     <UL>
        <LI>Frequency of buffer reading</LI> 
        <LI>Number of words to be read</LI>
        <LI>Maximum number of words to be dumped</LI>
      </UL></LI>
  <LI> Type of histograms to be booked(?)/filled/published
    <UL>
       <LI>Event Error histograms</LI>
       <LI>Standard monitoring histograms</LI>
       <LI>Histograms of physics quantities of interest</LI>
       <LI>histograms to be consulted by SVT Expert</LI>
    </UL></LI>
</UL>

NB. As we do now we'll probably continue booking the histograms statically in the 
crate processes and only broadly modify the fill/publish options. If on the otherhand, 
we want to configure options on a histogram-by-histogram basis, it becomes much more 
involved. In that case the extra step will be to read somehow the list of booked histograms 
from each crate and then select them for filling/publishing. <BR><BR>

<FONT size=-1>
Spy Buffer Monitoring and Analysis software is used to monitor the CDF Silicon 
Vertex Trigger performance in real time. The following basic tasks can be
performed with this software

<UL>
  <LI> Display SVT crate error status in detail, i.e statistics of 
       global errors from the spy buffers and board specific errors
       from board registers. One can select the crate which indicates
       the appearance of an error and logically explore the detail
       upto the spy buffers.</LI>
  <LI> Perform both expert and higher level error reporting.</LI>
  <LI> <I>Try to recover from SVT errors.</I></LI>
  <LI> Display and manipulate spy buffers read and analysed by the crate 
       processes from various SVT boards.</LI>
  <LI> Display histograms of interesting quantities which are created
       and published by the several SVT crate processes. </LI>
  <LI> Configure spy buffer reading and subsequent analysis.</LI>
  <LI> Respond to RC Control state transition commands and accordingly
       control the functioning of the crate process (optional). </LI>
</UL> 

The application is a SmartSockets client which communicates with the SVT 
crate processes and the spy manager (and possibly with the Run Control) and 
displays and transforms data read by the crate processes. It uses multiple 
threads of execution. In the ideal situation, the main thread of execution 
waits for the partitioning to be done and then sits in the GUI mainloop. 
One can use the main thread to configure analysis related settings whereas 
a new thread manages SmartSockets communications. For more technical information 
and for API level documentations please go to the 'Help' content of the main 
application.<BR>

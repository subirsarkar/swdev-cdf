<H2>SVT Crate Error Status Summary Window</H2>

<FONT size=-1>
Emulates the SVT hardware crate/board configuration (without cable connections). 
Standard colors for different elements, i.e board panels
are used which help us recognise the boards without explicitly labeling them.
We have also added two more help items to explain board panel color code
and the buttons on the board panels. For more information and board color 
codes consult the images stored in the svt page. In particular, look at 
<FONT color=red>

Boards which do not have Spy buffers 
are passive elements. The crate CPU panel is a button which shows a 
summary of status of all the Spy buffers which belong to that crate. Alternatively,
one can click on the buttons which show the (logical) crate names to display the same
informations.<BR>

<BR>Error Color Codes:

<UL>
  <LI><font color=red>Red</font>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp - Error has occurred in that element</LI>
  <LI><font color=green>Green</font> - Running alright as Spy Monitoring finds it</LI>
  <LI><font color=yellow>Yellow</font> - Element not available for monitoring</LI>
</UL>

This window should summarise all the relevant informations about the
functioning of SVT and hence may be open all through.<BR>

The LEDs on each board represent the following,

<UL>
  <LI>Top Panel
  <UL>
     <LI><FONT color=blue>EE Event related error</FONT> indicator. Error is 
         <FONT color=red>ON</FONT> if any of 
         the spy buffers in that board has an EE error. Selecting
         this button will show which buffers have errors.</LI>
     <LI><FONT color=blue>Spy Bufer related error</FONT> indicator. 
         Like the one above, but
         refers to the error related to Spy Buffer analysis, like
         simulation etc.</LI>
     <LI><FONT color=blue>Output Hold Error</FONT> indicator </LI>
  </UL></LI>
  <LI>Bottom Panel
  <UL>
     <LI><FONT color=blue>Board-in-Run/Test mode</FONT> indicator</LI>
     <LI><FONT color=blue>CDF/SVT error</FONT> indicator, an OR of the two</LI>
     <LI><FONT color=blue>Board error register</FONT> indicator. 
         It is an OR of all the 
         board error registers. Selecting this button shows 
         all the error registers for that board and indicates
         where the error has occurred. </LI>
  </UL></LI>
</UL>

The LEDs are buttons as well and can be selected to display details of the occurrance 
of an error. By default a new frame is opened following a button click which contains
error informations for the whole system. One can, alternatively, check
<FONT COLOR=red>Show Errors on Separate Windows</FONT> to views informations only for
a single element.

The <B>Options</B> menu contains two items, namely <I>Show TMode Warning</I> 
and <I>Show Output Hold Warning</I>. At each iteration, once the panels are updated, 
we check if any board is in test mode and if the board output is in hold. If so and 
the above options are selected, warning is issued. A <I>Reset Errors</I> is also added
which will reset errors on the client side.<BR>
